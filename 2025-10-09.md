# Technical Report: Mapping NSTA Well Database Schema to OSDU-Compliant Storage for Geoscience Data Interoperability

---

## Introduction

The landscape of subsurface data management in the energy sector is undergoing a revolutionary transformation. Central to this evolution are emergent open standards such as the Open Subsurface Data Universe (OSDU) Data Platform, which is designed to break down data silos and enable interoperability across operators, vendors, and systems12. The North Sea Transition Authority (NSTA) maintains one of the most comprehensive well databases globally, containing a wealth of geoscientific data critical to exploration, appraisal, and operational workflows in the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS) and adjacent areas34. However, the value of such data can only be fully realized if it is seamlessly integrable with industry-standard platforms like OSDU.

Designing an ingestion pipeline that maps the NSTA well database schema to an OSDU-compliant structure thus becomes a high-impact endeavor. It not only ensures interoperability and longevity for NSTA assets but also positions energy companies to harness cross-operator analytics, workflow automation, and AI-driven insights. This technical report provides a comprehensive review of the schema mapping process, best practices, required standards, and practical considerations for building a robust, scalable, and governance-compliant ingestion pipeline for integrating NSTA well data into an OSDU ecosystem.

## NSTA Well Database Schema Overview

The NSTA publishes rich well data, including regulatory identifiers, spud dates, bottom hole locations, stratigraphy, lithology, operator history, license details, measurements, and various geophysical logs34. Data is available through well-documented public releases, including Access databases, shapefiles, and REST APIs.

### Main Data Themes and Field Types

- **Identification & Lifecycle:** Well origin, regulatory numbers, spud/completion dates, parent/child relationships
    
- **Intent, Status, Classification:** Operational intent, status codes, development types, aliases
    
- **Location & Targeting:** Surface locations, slot number, multilateral indicators, field/prospect targeting
    
- **License & Operator Data:** License type and number, operator (current/previous/subarea), license at total depth
    
- **Reservoir, Deviation, Datum:** Reservoir assignments, deviation type, vertical datums, measured/true/vertical depths
    
- **Environmental & Facility:** Elevations, water depth, ground level, associated platform/facility data
    
- **Fluids, Flow, Pressure, Temperature:** Fluid types, flow classification, min/max temp/pressure, well classification
    
- **Country & Reference Data:** Official country codes, geocoding for regulatory compliance45.
    

NSTA fields are robust and granular, but the naming conventions and field groupings are tailored for UKCS-regulatory processes and may not match OSDU's global descriptors directly.

## OSDU Data Platform Core Schema

OSDU defines an open, extensible platform for storing and sharing subsurface data. The data model is formalized in JSON schemas (draft-07), managed centrally via the OSDU Schema Service, and organized by well-known schema (WKS) "kind" identifiers (e.g., `osdu:master-data--Well:1.0.0`)678.

### Principal Schema Entities for Well Data

- **Master Data:**
    
    - `Well`: Holds business context (RegulatoryID, Name, CountryID, etc.)
        
    - `Wellbore`: Details execution/lifecycle, depths, datums, locations, measurements, status
        
    - `Reservoir`, `Facility`, `Platform`, etc.: For related entities and relationships
        
- **Reference Data:**
    
    - Code catalogs for deviation types, license types, operators, geologic ages, datum types, fluid types, etc.
        
- **Work Product Data:**
    
    - Datasets, logs, markers, reports tied to well/wellbore entities.
        
- **System Entities:**
    
    - Metadata block (`meta`), legal and entitlements blocks (`legal`, `acl`), timestamps, versioning.
        
    - Data container (`data`) for core business fields.
        
    - Extension points for non-OSDU content (via `data.ExtensionProperties`).
        

**Relationships** between entities are captured as string references pointing to `id:version` pairs, and relationships can be further controlled via schema decorators (e.g., `x-osdu-relationship`)8.

### Relevant OSDU JSON Schemas

OSDU schemas are versioned, portable JSON files, registered and managed via the Schema Service:

- Example: [`Well.1.0.0.json`](https://Well.1.0.0.json), [`Wellbore.1.4.0.json`](https://Wellbore.1.4.0.json), [`ReferenceOperator.1.0.0.json`](https://ReferenceOperator.1.0.0.json)78.
    
- Custom or missing schemas can be scaffolded as needed and registered for use.
    
- Reference data governance (FIXED/OPEN/LOCAL) determines how code lists are extended or controlled.
    

**Schema fragments** and nested objects streamline re-use and composability across well data representations8.

## Schema Mapping Strategies: NSTA to OSDU

Schema mapping is the process of translating each NSTA field to its OSDU equivalent, ensuring not only structural compatibility but also semantic alignment and preservation of data quality. The process is considerably aided by resources such as the **GeomaticsGlen NSTA-OSDU schema checklist**, which systematically matches NSTA field names to their corresponding OSDU fields, JSON schema files, and documentation links59.

Stepwise Mapping Approach

1. **Field-Level Mapping:** Establish direct NSTA-to-OSDU correspondences. For example, NSTA's `WELLREGNO` corresponds to OSDU's `RegulatoryID` within [`Well.1.0.0.json`](https://Well.1.0.0.json).
    
2. **Reference Data Normalization:** Map or translate NSTA classification and code fields to OSDU ReferenceData catalogs (e.g., license types, intent types).
    
3. **Entity Relationship Construction:** Encode relationships as per OSDU's `id:version` string references.
    
4. **Data Block Construction:** Populate the `data` block for each well, wellbore, facility, or reservoir record, using mapped field values.
    
5. **Add Metadata/System Properties:** Attach legal tags, ACLs, creation/modification times, and versioning as per OSDU schema.
    
6. **Validation and Testing:** Use OSDU’s validation tools to ensure schema and reference value conformance.
    
7. **Handling Missing Fields:** For NSTA fields not covered in current OSDU schemas, consider extending schemas (via extension points or custom schemas), following OSDU’s change management and governance practices.
    

### GeomaticsGlen Schema Checklist: Mapping Table (Excerpt)

|NSTA Field|OSDU Field|OSDU Schema File|Status (Y/N)|
|---|---|---|---|
|WELLORIGIN|WellID|[Wellbore.1.4.0.json](https://Wellbore.1.4.0.json)|Y|
|ORIGINSTAT|OriginStatusID|[Wellbore.1.4.0.json](https://Wellbore.1.4.0.json)|Y|
|PARENTWELL|ParentWellID|[Wellbore.1.4.0.json](https://Wellbore.1.4.0.json)|Y|
|WELLREGNO|RegulatoryID|[Well.1.0.0.json](https://Well.1.0.0.json)|Y|
|SPUDDATE|SpudDate|[Wellbore.1.4.0.json](https://Wellbore.1.4.0.json)|Y|
|...|...|...|...|
|FLUIDTYPES|FluidTypeID|[ReferenceFluidType.1.0.0.json](https://ReferenceFluidType.1.0.0.json)|N|
|COUNTRYCOD|CountryID|[Well.1.0.0.json](https://Well.1.0.0.json)|Y|

_In total, the checklist contains over a hundred such mappings, each thoroughly documented_9.

Crucially, the checklist includes schema names for fields not yet present in standard OSDU, flagging them for scaffolding and governance submission.

### Handling Non-Standard or Custom Fields

- **Extension Points:** Use `data.ExtensionProperties` for non-standard properties, but note these are not indexed for search by default78.
    
- **Side-Car Extensions:** For domain-specific additions, create side-car schemas, linking them back to main well entities by id.
    
- **Governance:** Engage with the OSDU Data Definitions workgroup to contribute enhancements needed for broad industry use.

## Integration Patterns and Workflow Automation

Integration of legacy databases like NSTA with OSDU isn’t trivial—it requires addressing data heterogeneity, reference alignment, and orchestration across different technologies112. Best practices include:

### Core Integration Patterns

1. **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load):** Data is extracted from NSTA sources; transformed/mapped using schema checklists and validation tools; and loaded into OSDU via APIs or ingestion services.
    
    - Batch or streaming supported; transformation may use Python, Spark, or cloud pipeline tools, aided by JSON schema validators.
        
2. **API-Based Ingestion:** OSDU exposes RESTful APIs for storage, search, update, and retrieval; data loaders or middleware use these directly after mapping.
    
3. **Event-Driven Pipelines:** Tooling such as Amazon AppFlow can trigger pipeline executions in response to new NSTA dataset releases or updates (event-based automation, e.g., after regulatory filings)12.
    
4. **Federated Query and Caching:** For accessing both OSDU-ingested and on-prem NSTA data, pipelines can implement federated queries and edge caches to balance cost, latency, and regulatory considerations13.
    
5. **Custom Adapters/Connectors:** Where NSTA field semantics don't align, use custom code or low-code adapters to validate, enrich, or normalize data during ingestion.
    

### Workflow Automation and EDM

Workflow automation platforms (like EDM for Energy) facilitate:

- Declarative mapping, reducing manual coding for field translation
    
- Data quality checks, deduplication, and master record creation
    
- Audit tracking of all transformation and loading events
    
- Stakeholder notification and automatic retraining or rescanning when schema versions or business rules change2.

## OSDU Technical Standards, Best Practices, and Governance

Ensuring compliant, sustainable, and future-proof integration with OSDU requires adherence to several core standards and participation in ongoing community governance.

### Core OSDU Standards

- **OSDU Technical Standard (latest at 2025: Venus Release):** Specifies the normative requirements for OSDU platform providers, API behaviors, and conformance tests for core services (schema, storage, indexer, search, legal, entitlements, delivery, registration, etc.)171819.
    
- **Schema Definition and Registration:** All data must conform to registered JSON schemas; new schemas or extensions require registration through the OSDU Schema Service and must adopt semantic versioning7820.
    
- **Reference Data Governance:** Determines changemanagement of code lists (e.g., open, fixed, local) to ensure global interoperability while allowing local extensions as needed.
    
- **Record Identifier and Kind:** All OSDU records use URN-style identifiers and are required to specify their schema “kind” for disambiguation and versioned compatibility7821.
    
- **Legal and Access Controls:** Use `legal` tags and `acl` blocks to manage data privacy, export controls, transient data rooms, and national regulations (e.g., GDPR, export bans)22.
    
- **Data Quality and Technical Assurance:** OSDU defines optional but recommended mechanisms for tagging quality, completeness, and technical suitability for different persona or workflow use cases.
    

### Contribution and Extension

- **Community and Governance:** The OSDU community is open source, merit-based, and encourages operators and vendors like NSTA and its partners to contribute new schema fragments and enhancements23.
    
- **Change Management:** Schema and code contributions are managed via GitLab merge requests and protected by comprehensive CI/CD pipelines and code review processes2425.
    
- **Best Practice:** Avoid proprietary or "one-off" schema extensions outside the OSDU registry; instead use extension points where possible and promote harmonization through the Data Definition workgroups78.
    

### Data Validation and Schema Version Management

- **Schema Validation:** Ingestion pipelines should validate data pre-loading using the JSON schema and reference data; failing records should be quarantined and causes logged for remediation8.
    
- **Semantic Versioning:** Use wildcards for minor and patch versions in search queries, but align ingestion with platform owner/operator’s preferred or allowed versions (this enables in-place upgrades and rollback)8.
    

---

## Data Definitions and Reference Data

Mapping NSTA to OSDU requires meticulous attention to the data definition—the shape, type, and semantics of each attribute. OSDU provides a hierarchical structure for managing these definitions:

- **Master Data Schemas:** Define primary entities (e.g., Well, Wellbore)
    
- **Reference Data Schemas:** Standard catalogs for codes, e.g.,:
    
    - `ReferenceDevelopmentType`, `ReferenceLicenceType`, `ReferenceOperator`, `ReferenceFluidType`, `ReferenceDatumType`, etc.26
        
- **Work Product Schemas:** For consumable datasets and interpretations
    

**Reference Value Governance:** For critical catalogs, the code list is either:

- `FIXED`: immutable unless changed by OSDU governors (e.g., unit of measure codes)
    
- `OPEN`: extensible by operators but OSDU-provided values cannot be removed
    
- `LOCAL`: fully local and modifiable by platform owners
    

Data ingestion pipelines must align with the governance mode for each catalog—critical for regulatory compliance and global data sharing scenarios.

---

## JSON Schema Management in OSDU

JSON Schema (draft-07) is the cornerstone of OSDU’s data governance and interoperability. Key points for practitioners:

- **Schema Registration:** All entity types must have their schemas registered with the Schema Service, referenced by unique “kind” strings6.
    
- **System vs. Data Properties:** System fields (e.g., id, version, legal) are non-extensible; all extensibility is within the `data` block or via `ExtensionProperties`.
    
- **Decorator Extensions:** OSDU uses custom schema extensions (e.g., `x-osdu-virtual-properties`, `x-osdu-relationship`, `x-osdu-indexing`) to guide how search, discovery, and relationships are handled8.
    
- **Schema Fragments and Side-Car Patterns:** Promote re-use and efficient ad hoc extension without polluting core entities.
    
- **Schema Upgrade and Versioning:** Schema evolution is supported via prescribed upgrade paths, custom transformation (JOLT scripts), and controlled rollout, minimizing downstream disruption.
    

---

## Microservices and OSDU API Architecture

The OSDU ecosystem is architected as a cloud-scale, microservices-based platform:

- **Componentized Core Services:** Schema, Storage, Indexer, Search, Entitlements, Legal, Delivery, Notification, Registration, etc.
    
- **API-First:** All interaction is via RESTful APIs with strong authentication (OAuth/JWT schemes), enabling loose coupling and multi-language consumption176.
    
- **Scalable Workflows:** Ingestion, enrichment, data discovery, and delivery are scalable via platform-specific orchestrations (e.g., Airflow DAGs, managed ETL tools)10.
    
- **Extensibility:** Custom microservices can be deployed for validation, transformation, or integration with external systems, registered and orchestrated via workflow APIs.
    
- **Federated and Hybrid-Cloud Support:** Multi-cloud and edge patterns are supported out-of-the-box for regulatory or cost optimization131112.
    

---

## Interoperability Considerations and Data Governance

### Interoperability Enablers

- **Standardized Entity and Attribute Definitions:** Maps like the NSTA-OSDU checklist enable cross-operator and multi-vendor harmonization of business concepts, avoiding ambiguous mappings and providing consistent interpretation across the industry.
    
- **Open APIs and Schema-Driven Contracts:** Schemas define not only field structure but validation, permit extensibility, and drive code generation and documentation tools (e.g., Swagger, OpenAPI).
    
- **Reference Data Alignment:** Use of shared catalogs for key codes (development type, operator, license, etc.) ensures data from NSTA is directly comparable and aggregable with data from other regulators and operators.
    
- **Entitlements, ACLs, and Legal Tags:** Support fine-grained access, competitor-safe data room operations, and regional regulatory controls. These are mandatory in all OSDU records and must be meticulously mapped from NSTA access and license constraints.
    

### Data Quality and Governance

- **Quality Assessment and Tagging:** Ingestion should include checks for completeness, consistency, and domain compliance, tagging records that require technical assurance or do not meet minimal standards71416.
    
- **Workflow Automation for Governance:** EDM and similar platforms allow governance rules to be implemented declaratively, with every data flow tracked, audited, and re-doable in case of schema or business rule changes.
    
- **Compliance with OSDU Policy Manager:** Embedding and enforcing policies during ingestion guarantees only compliant data is exposed, especially critical for cross-jurisdictional or regulated data types (e.g., exports, joint-venture obligations, economic sanctions)22.
    

### Future-Proofing and Continuous Improvement

- **Participation in OSDU Community:** Proactively contribute missing mappings, enhancements, and test cases back to the OSDU Data Definitions and Schema Service community repositories and forums23.
    
- **Regular Version Audits:** Stay abreast of new schema releases and modify pipelines as required, using semantic versioning and schema upgrade mechanisms to avoid disruption.
    
- **API and Data Discovery Best Practices:** Structure records and metadata so that well data can be efficiently discovered, searched, and accessed using OSDU's search APIs without manual cataloging.
